## Description

my motivation for this project was to see how i can use javascript API's in a coding program to make a responsive browser.  The reason I built this project was because I felt it included a lot of the fundamentals we learned throughout module 4 and would help me see my knowledge from that unit or better grasp the concepts.  The problem I solved was really understanding how to attach my variables and content within javascript and use them within my html in order to make my browser more interactive and have an overall cleaner look.  The things I learned during this challenge was the forEach method and how it functions for an array and using it to create buttons for each(pun intended) of my elements within my array.  I also learned the arrow function and how it can save space. By using this farrow function I'm able to run my code through a function without having to actually call it.  Last thing I learned was the '${}' notation and how it takes an object and makes it into a string value.
